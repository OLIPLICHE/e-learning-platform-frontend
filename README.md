## The learning objective of this project are
- Create react front end app

- Use API end point to get data
- Fetch data from the API

## Built With

- Git

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


### Setup
- ```git@github.com:OLIPLICHE/e-learning-platform-frontend.git```

- ```cd e-learning-platform-frontend```

### Running The App

- Run ```npm install``` to install all the necessary gems
- Make sure to run our [Rails backend](https://e-learning-back.herokuapp.com/) application first before running the React app so that it takes up the `port 3000` for the API to work.

- Once the back end is runing on `port 3000` then start the react app and you will be prompted to run the server on another port like `port 3001`.
